Driver for the SUPERFLEX modelling framework focusing on uncertainty analysis and plotting

This code is an R wrapper for the SUPERFLEX framework for conceptual hydrological models by [Fenicia et al., 2011](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2010WR010174).
The prerequisite for using this driver is a DLL that contains the major model-evaluating functions of SUPERFLEX, which are accessed by this driver.
